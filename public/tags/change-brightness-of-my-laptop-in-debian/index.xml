      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;strong&gt;Acer Aspire 5733&lt;/strong&gt; and i couldn’t change brightness of my laptop. This is annoying and painful. I have tried many things to do this but couldn’t solve it as there is no linux graphics driver. At last i have found a solution and i have written an script which will be helpful for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
