      <description>&lt;p&gt;We do use internet everyday for mailing,sharing thoughts,working,uploading files etc in several sites like Facebook,Twitter,Tumblr,Gmail etc. They are free. But we have to agree with their Terms of service and Privacy Policies. No one reads those i guess ðŸ™‚ . But i have found some interesting lines there. I am collecting those lines for fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
