      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bridges are a very important structure of a society or civilization.

I have collected this information from Wikipedia and other sites. You will definitely learn something interesting. I was researching this as my course teacher asked me to submit an assignment paper about Types of Bridges and their little information including pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
