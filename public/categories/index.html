      Docker is one of the most wonderful tool for development scenario. It is very important now a days. I did have knowledge in this, but that seems scattered knowledge. Thus, I wanted to learn it as through as possible and share it here and in github with a repo name of GetDockerized: https://github.com/fahadahammed/GetDockerizedHope to learn a lot and will be able to focus properly.

      <p>Containerization gives us many benefits from packaging to distribution and others. Thus, Docker is widely used as a containerization tool which is designed for running specific tasks and processes, not for hosting operating systems or like other virtualization tools like VMWare, VirtualBox etc. You create a container to serve a single unit task. Once it completes the given task, it stops. The container life-cycle depends on the ongoing process inside of it. Once the process stops,</p>

This is very useful if you do Craigslist work or something like that. Proxy is interesting. Squid proxy is like a Swiss Army Knife which has numerous feature to make you comfortable with proxy.</p>

Actually this problem arises when your ISP have no IPV6 for you. And Google,Facebook type giant sites has IPV6. So Squid just route you to access by IPV6 whether you have or not. As you have no IPV6 , you are facing problem.</p>

These boards play a significant role in my home lab for different experiments like Docker Private Repository, Media Server, Ad Blocker with pi-hole, Secure Proxy for anonymity, secure network access with VPN, Home Security Camera/Surveillance, Data Collector or scraper etc. But This time, I did buy a “DHT-22” sensor for monitoring room temperature and humidity.

      <p>Containerization gives us many benefits from packaging to distribution and others. Thus, Docker is widely used as a containerization tool which is designed for running specific tasks and processes, not for hosting operating systems or like other virtualization tools like VMWare, VirtualBox etc. You create a container to serve a single unit task. Once it completes the given task, it stops. The container life-cycle depends on the ongoing process inside of it. Once the process stops,</p>

According to recent super computer “K Computer” which is the fastest can calculate 8,200,000,000,000,000 (8.2 quadrillion) calculations per second. Lets see how many seconds would take to decrypt an encrypted file by the way i am showing.</p>
