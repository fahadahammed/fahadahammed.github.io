      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing with RaspberryPI for a while. There are several project I tried to do with RaspberryPI. These boards play a significant role in my home lab for different experiments like Docker Private Repository, Media Server, Ad Blocker with pi-hole, Secure Proxy for anonymity, secure network access with VPN, Home Security Camera/Surveillance, Data Collector or scraper etc. But This time, I did buy a “DHT-22” sensor for monitoring room temperature and humidity. Humidity is my main concern and wanted to see how it fluctuates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my main plan was to get a DHT-22 to connect properly&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most basic things to do in a Linux Server. We can use just &lt;code&gt;passwd &amp;lt;user&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to change the password of a user. But to do that in 100s of server can be a tricky one. Ansible is the savior on that perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to manage time to explore InfluxDB for observability. This article is one of many about InfluxDB and Telegraf. I will cover basic installation here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
