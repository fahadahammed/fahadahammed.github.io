      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing with RaspberryPI for a while. There are several project I tried to do with RaspberryPI. These boards play a significant role in my home lab for different experiments like Docker Private Repository, Media Server, Ad Blocker with pi-hole, Secure Proxy for anonymity, secure network access with VPN, Home Security Camera/Surveillance, Data Collector or scraper etc. But This time, I did buy a “DHT-22” sensor for monitoring room temperature and humidity. Humidity is my main concern and wanted to see how it fluctuates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my main plan was to get a DHT-22 to connect properly&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always worked with Linux Systems and thus Bash was my go to tool for some specific tasks. But now I am much more aware with Python than Bash as it does give me better grasp on things. I am not saying that for server scripting, Bash can not do some tasks. It can be used in a vast area of things to solve. But I am now comfortable with Python more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I did stumble upon of a task that was related to comparing two huge CSV files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SSH Config and Ansible Host Generator and Why I am doing it this way?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am recently playing the role as an SRE and that is why I have to deal with a lot of servers. Not only cloud once or clusters but also bare metals as well as Virtual Machines. For more systematic environment preparation, I have Gitlab pipeline. But for basic tasks like change the config on demand or check a specific directory or search something or any other unpredictable or repeated tasks, I need Ansible for better grasp from my local machine or Bastion server. So, what do I have to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an entry to the .ssh/config file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an entry ansible host file as inventory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeated tasks? For me, yes. I needed to manage these. So, created a python script&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Understanding about RUN, CMD and ENTRYPOINT in Dockerfile</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Containerization gives us many benefits from packaging to distribution and others. Thus, Docker is widely used as a containerization tool which is designed for running specific tasks and processes, not for hosting operating systems or like other virtualization tools like VMWare, VirtualBox etc. You create a container to serve a single unit task. Once it completes the given task, it stops. The container life-cycle depends on the ongoing process inside of it. Once the process stops,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working with redis and python for sometime. It is fun to play with python and redis. There are so many things can be solved by redis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session persistency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volatile Datastore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job or Message Queue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And many more. But recently I was thinking about using it as main database. I am not yet sure what kind of problem I might face or what things to optimize when it is about scalability or reliability. I will for sure share my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I want to talk about –&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to run Python Flask Application?</title>
      <link>https://www.fahadahammed.com/how-to-run-python-flask-application/</link>

      <guid>https://www.fahadahammed.com/how-to-run-python-flask-application/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I mostly use Python Flask when I need to develop a Web App or API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Because it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lightweight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very Flexible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Micro-Service Friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are one of the main reasons I choose Flask. But mostly I love to code with Flask. There are so many ways to run flask applications. I will write some of them here with code examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the website, Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I am going to share a basic way to start using Apache Kafka with python.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pythons datetime of a timezone</title>
      <link>https://www.fahadahammed.com/pythons-datetime-of-a-timezone/</link>

      <guid>https://www.fahadahammed.com/pythons-datetime-of-a-timezone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In python, we can use &lt;strong&gt;datetime&lt;/strong&gt; module from standard library for manipulating dates and times. From the documentation, we can say, date and time objects may be categorized as “aware” or “naive” depending on whether or not they include timezone information. How can we get a &lt;strong&gt;datetime&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Raspberry Pi and Docker Registry</title>
      <link>https://www.fahadahammed.com/raspberry-pi-and-docker-registry/</link>

      <guid>https://www.fahadahammed.com/raspberry-pi-and-docker-registry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been using a &lt;strong&gt;Raspberry Pi 3B+&lt;/strong&gt; bought from a classified advertisement site called &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Bikroy.com&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. A student wanted to sell this, as his final college project was done. It was cheaper with an acrylic casing and a fan. However, I wanted to use this Pi for several pet projects. Initially I did install &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Pi-Hole&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; for network wide &lt;strong&gt;adblocker&lt;/strong&gt; and along with &lt;strong&gt;samba&lt;/strong&gt; with a spare portable hard disk. It was working OK. No extra pressure in this 1GB ram Pi. I thought Why not give it a little bit more pressure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I planned to install docker registry in it for my &lt;strong&gt;“local private docker hub”&lt;/strong&gt; type of need. Let me share what I had to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Again Fibonacci Series and Python</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have already wrote a piece about generating Fibonacci series in &lt;strong&gt;BASH&lt;/strong&gt;, here in my blog. But today I am gonna do some practice stuff with &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all I guess know about &lt;strong&gt;Fibonacci&lt;/strong&gt;. It is connected to nature through the golden ratio and the spirals. It is a very interesting series to learn or research deeply. However, I came to know that there is a day declared as “&lt;strong&gt;Fibonacci Day&lt;/strong&gt;” which is every 23rd, November. But why?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multi line Log Parser in Python</title>
      <link>https://www.fahadahammed.com/multi-line-log-parser-in-python/</link>

      <guid>https://www.fahadahammed.com/multi-line-log-parser-in-python/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I have a log file that is not single line log. It is kind of java stack trace. What I needed to do is read those log files and create some actions depending on them. I could use already built tools. But I thought why not just do this as simply as printing strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of the log format I wanted to play with. It seems too simple to pile up the Filebeats or elastic stack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy coding and solving problems. But as I go forward, I find myself in a sea of unknowns. Thus I decided to learn as much as possible to be confident. So, I am learning even the simplest it seems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The built-in function “eval()” of python is useful in many cases. But I am gonna talk about it’s negative one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let, you have a function that take arguments from user. If you do eval() on that input, it might create a havoc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always loved the fact that The Python interpreter has a number of functions and types built into it. I am going to explore “eval()” in this article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am gonna talk about Git. We all somehow use git and thus it is important for us to better use &lt;strong&gt;.gitignore&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
