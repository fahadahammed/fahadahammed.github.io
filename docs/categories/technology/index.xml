      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing with RaspberryPI for a while. There are several project I tried to do with RaspberryPI. These boards play a significant role in my home lab for different experiments like Docker Private Repository, Media Server, Ad Blocker with pi-hole, Secure Proxy for anonymity, secure network access with VPN, Home Security Camera/Surveillance, Data Collector or scraper etc. But This time, I did buy a “DHT-22” sensor for monitoring room temperature and humidity. Humidity is my main concern and wanted to see how it fluctuates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my main plan was to get a DHT-22 to connect properly&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was trying explore some data in Google Sheet and stumble upon a unique problem. There were several columns and rows of data containing strings. I wanted to count specific string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to find out how many “aD” in whole set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ansible to change user password</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most basic things to do in a Linux Server. We can use just &lt;code&gt;passwd &amp;lt;user&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to change the password of a user. But to do that in 100s of server can be a tricky one. Ansible is the savior on that perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always worked with Linux Systems and thus Bash was my go to tool for some specific tasks. But now I am much more aware with Python than Bash as it does give me better grasp on things. I am not saying that for server scripting, Bash can not do some tasks. It can be used in a vast area of things to solve. But I am now comfortable with Python more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I did stumble upon of a task that was related to comparing two huge CSV files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SSH Config and Ansible Host Generator and Why I am doing it this way?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am recently playing the role as an SRE and that is why I have to deal with a lot of servers. Not only cloud once or clusters but also bare metals as well as Virtual Machines. For more systematic environment preparation, I have Gitlab pipeline. But for basic tasks like change the config on demand or check a specific directory or search something or any other unpredictable or repeated tasks, I need Ansible for better grasp from my local machine or Bastion server. So, what do I have to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an entry to the .ssh/config file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an entry ansible host file as inventory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeated tasks? For me, yes. I needed to manage these. So, created a python script&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently been practicing &lt;strong&gt;TMUX&lt;/strong&gt; for my day to day tasks. To be honest, I am late. I should have get used to it earlier. It is much more robust and well sorted than the other &lt;strong&gt;terminal multiplexers&lt;/strong&gt; such as &lt;strong&gt;screen&lt;/strong&gt;. How am I adapting?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Containerization gives us many benefits from packaging to distribution and others. Thus, Docker is widely used as a containerization tool which is designed for running specific tasks and processes, not for hosting operating systems or like other virtualization tools like VMWare, VirtualBox etc. You create a container to serve a single unit task. Once it completes the given task, it stops. The container life-cycle depends on the ongoing process inside of it. Once the process stops,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working with redis and python for sometime. It is fun to play with python and redis. There are so many things can be solved by redis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session persistency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volatile Datastore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job or Message Queue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And many more. But recently I was thinking about using it as main database. I am not yet sure what kind of problem I might face or what things to optimize when it is about scalability or reliability. I will for sure share my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I want to talk about –&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether you have SSD with NVME Protocol or good old HDD, It is not going to make you feel superior than your Random Access Memory or RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By creating a &lt;strong&gt;ramdisk&lt;/strong&gt;, you can use your unused memory as a super fast disk space and work with it. I do need to use &lt;strong&gt;nginx&lt;/strong&gt; and for caching, I always go to &lt;strong&gt;tmpfs&lt;/strong&gt; which is filesystem type that typically uses ram. How do I create one?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://fahadahammed.github.io/how-to-run-python-flask-application/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I mostly use Python Flask when I need to develop a Web App or API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Because it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lightweight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very Flexible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Micro-Service Friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are one of the main reasons I choose Flask. But mostly I love to code with Flask. There are so many ways to run flask applications. I will write some of them here with code examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of tools I need to work with. Installing some tools in my workstation and bloating the system is not an option with limited memory capacity, specially in MacBook Air M1 with 8GB of ram. So, I am using docker when using those tools. The day to day life depends on these DB tools –&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Raspberry Pi and Docker Registry</title>

      <guid>https://fahadahammed.github.io/raspberry-pi-and-docker-registry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been using a &lt;strong&gt;Raspberry Pi 3B+&lt;/strong&gt; bought from a classified advertisement site called &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Bikroy.com&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. A student wanted to sell this, as his final college project was done. It was cheaper with an acrylic casing and a fan. However, I wanted to use this Pi for several pet projects. Initially I did install &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Pi-Hole&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; for network wide &lt;strong&gt;adblocker&lt;/strong&gt; and along with &lt;strong&gt;samba&lt;/strong&gt; with a spare portable hard disk. It was working OK. No extra pressure in this 1GB ram Pi. I thought Why not give it a little bit more pressure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I planned to install docker registry in it for my &lt;strong&gt;“local private docker hub”&lt;/strong&gt; type of need. Let me share what I had to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multi line Log Parser in Python</title>

      <guid>https://fahadahammed.github.io/multi-line-log-parser-in-python/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I have a log file that is not single line log. It is kind of java stack trace. What I needed to do is read those log files and create some actions depending on them. I could use already built tools. But I thought why not just do this as simply as printing strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of the log format I wanted to play with. It seems too simple to pile up the Filebeats or elastic stack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using git is somehow easier when you just stick into normal workflow or working all alone in a project. Also it is easier as there are many GUI available. But there are some possibility on falling into critical situations where GUI may not be the right tool to stick with. I will share some situations here and the right commands which will save you from doing useless commits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You might somehow face a huge traffic on your site which is not legitimate at all and kind of DOS. If you can identify the traffic which eventually lessen the site performance by the &lt;strong&gt;Basic HTTP Floods&lt;/strong&gt; DOS, you can save yourself from being affected by mild DOS attack. I will show you how can lessen the chance of being easily affected by those attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whatever you say against Ubuntu, you can’t just make it less popular. It is the most popular Linux distribution. Many companies rely on this distribution. I personally use it on my laptop and in my servers. Normally people use windows, and when it comes to Linux it becomes a whole other matter. If someone use Ubuntu but later he wanted to install install latest windows or old alongside Ubuntu, he may face problem as loosing Ubuntu. That is what i am gong to explain “Ubuntu Recover Procedure”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to encrypt files and folders lately. It is fun but useful. You can encrypt any file which can take several years to decrypt for a hacker. That “Several” is not less. According to recent super computer “K Computer” which is the fastest can calculate 8,200,000,000,000,000 (8.2 quadrillion) calculations per second. Lets see how many seconds would take to decrypt an encrypted file by the way i am showing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have any additional disks, you can create a file somewhere on your filesystem, and use that file for swap space. Normally some vps providers don’t give swap. For those who has that type of vps will need this tutorial to get a swap to faster website or vps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is annoying to get &lt;strong&gt;file exceeds the max size allowed&lt;/strong&gt; when you try for uploading files. How can you be able to upload bigger files without any caution or error ? We have to find &lt;strong&gt;php.ini&lt;/strong&gt; file from your system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://fahadahammed.github.io/bundle-css-to-load-page-faster/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A test with a simple HTML page over a DSL connection shows that one big stylesheet or css of 50 KB can speed up load time by factor 2 compared to five stylesheets that are 10 KB each in size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 Stylesheets (10KB each): 1100ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Stylesheet (50KB): 500ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So , How to make them one without breaking or editing them ? I am going to show you how to do this .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Caching with Varnish</title>
      <link>https://fahadahammed.github.io/caching-with-varnish/</link>

      <guid>https://fahadahammed.github.io/caching-with-varnish/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Varnish&lt;/strong&gt; is an HTTP accelerator designed for content-heavy dynamic web sites. In contrast to other web accelerators, such as Squid, which began life as a client-side cache, or Apache and nginx, which are primarily origin servers, Varnish was designed as an HTTP accelerator. Varnish is focused exclusively on HTTP, unlike other proxy servers that often support FTP, SMTP and other network protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here , I will explain how to get varnish in front of apache2 or accelerate apache2 with varnish .&lt;/p&gt;</description>
