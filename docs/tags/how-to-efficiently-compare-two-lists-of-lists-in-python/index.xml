      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always worked with Linux Systems and thus Bash was my go to tool for some specific tasks. But now I am much more aware with Python than Bash as it does give me better grasp on things. I am not saying that for server scripting, Bash can not do some tasks. It can be used in a vast area of things to solve. But I am now comfortable with Python more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I did stumble upon of a task that was related to comparing two huge CSV files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
