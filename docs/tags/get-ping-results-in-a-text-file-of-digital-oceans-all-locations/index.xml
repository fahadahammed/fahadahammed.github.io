      <description>&lt;p&gt;In DOS, OS/2, and also Microsoft Windows, batch file is the name given to a type of script file, a text file containing a series of commands to be executed by the command interpreter. A batch file may contain any command the interpreter accepts interactively at the command prompt. A batch file may also have constructs (IF, GOTO, Labels, CALL, etc.) that enable conditional branching and looping within the batch file. Recently i was playing with it and got a cool script while playing with ping command which will output ping results in a text file in Desktop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
