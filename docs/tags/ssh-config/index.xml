      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am recently playing the role as an SRE and that is why I have to deal with a lot of servers. Not only cloud once or clusters but also bare metals as well as Virtual Machines. For more systematic environment preparation, I have Gitlab pipeline. But for basic tasks like change the config on demand or check a specific directory or search something or any other unpredictable or repeated tasks, I need Ansible for better grasp from my local machine or Bastion server. So, what do I have to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an entry to the .ssh/config file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an entry ansible host file as inventory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeated tasks? For me, yes. I needed to manage these. So, created a python script&lt;/p&gt;</description>
