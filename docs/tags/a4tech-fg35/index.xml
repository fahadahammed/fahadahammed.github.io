      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using two mouse for my daily work in my laptop. Among them, I have &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Mi Portable Mouse&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; and another a local made without branding. But recently both of them showing faults on scroll wheel. Which is very annoying. Also Xiaomi does eat a lot of power. So, I though I should get a new wireless mouse. Thus I came to know about A4tech FG35. It seems will fit my need. I have found this mouse in several online stores.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
