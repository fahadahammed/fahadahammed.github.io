Docker is one of the most wonderful tool for development scenario. It is very important now a days. I did have knowledge in this, but that seems scattered knowledge. Thus, I wanted to learn it as through as possible and share it here and in github with a repo name of GetDockerized: <a href="https://github.com/fahadahammed/GetDockerized" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/fahadahammed/GetDockerized</a>

Hope to learn a lot and will be able to focus properly.
