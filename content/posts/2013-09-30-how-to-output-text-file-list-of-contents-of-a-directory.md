If you have a folder with huge contents and you want to get a list from them what will you do ? Write down one by one ? ðŸ˜›

In Linux based distributions you can get a list by a simple command.

Open terminal. Go to your desired folder by cd command.

<pre>cd /your/folder/path/</pre>

Now if you want to get the list of that folder contents then you can simply get by below command.

<pre>ls &gt; file_list.txt</pre>

If you want to get a detailed list of that folder contents then use this.

<pre>ls -l &gt; file_list.txt</pre>

If you want to get a list of that folder contents with hidden ones then use this.

<pre>ls -a &gt; file_list.txt</pre>

If you want to get a detailed list of that folder contents with hidden ones then use this.

<pre>ls -la &gt; file_list.txt</pre>

If you want to get a list of that folder and all sub-folder contents then use this.

<pre>ls -R &gt; file_list.txt</pre>

If you want to get a detailed list of that folder and all sub-folder contents then use this.

<pre>ls -lR &gt; file_list.txt</pre>

If you want to get a detailed list of that folder and all sub-folder contents with hidden ones then use this.

<pre>ls -laR &gt; file_list.txt</pre>
