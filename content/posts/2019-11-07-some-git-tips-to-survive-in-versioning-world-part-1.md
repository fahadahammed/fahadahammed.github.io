I am gonna talk about Git. We all somehow use git and thus it is important for us to better use **.gitignore**.

<!--more-->

## How to allow only certain files of a repository on git commit?

To deny all and allow few, we can use **&#8220;!&#8221;**.

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted"># Ignore all with * and ! to not to ignore /
*
!/
# Allow only NewFolder and it's contents
!NewFolder
!NewFolder/*</pre>

Remember to change the **&#8220;.gitignore&#8221;** file before committing all the files.
