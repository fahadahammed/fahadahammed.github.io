If you have linux server or linux operating system(distribution) in your pc then you are using bash. Bash is a command processor and Unix Shell, typically run in a text window, allowing the user to type commands which cause actions. Bash can also read commands from a file, called a script. Bash keep records of executing commands and all. Sometimes if you want to clean all your records you can follow this.<!--more-->

`~/.bash_history` holds the history.

To clear the bash history completely on the server. You can open terminal and type

`cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history`

Other alternative way is to link

`~/.bash_history` to `/dev/null`

On my Debian Wheezy box, The history comes back when I login back. I guess because the history entries has a copy in the memory and it will flush back to the file when you log out. The following command worked for me.

`cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history && history -c && exit`

I think this will do the work. ðŸ™‚
