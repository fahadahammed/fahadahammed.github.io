We do use internet everyday for mailing,sharing thoughts,working,uploading files etc in several sites like Facebook,Twitter,Tumblr,Gmail etc. They are free. But we have to agree with their Terms of service and Privacy Policies. No one reads those i guess üôÇ . But i have found some interesting lines there. I am collecting those lines for fun.

### Tumblr:

> We‚Äôre just letting you know, here, that we were recently acquired by Yahoo! Inc. This section also includes an agreement where you&#8217;re agreeing to agree to the terms of this agreement.

Below one is Epic üòÄ

> You have to be at least 13 years old to use Tumblr. We&#8217;re serious: it&#8217;s a hard rule, based on U.S. federal and state legislation. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm, like, 12.9 years old!‚Äù you plead. Nope, sorry. If you&#8217;re younger than 13, don&#8217;t use Tumblr. Ask your parents for a Playstation 4, or try books.

Below one is really sweet

<div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      When you upload your creations to Tumblr, you‚Äôre giving us permission to make them available in all the ways you would expect us to (for example, via your blog, RSS, the Tumblr Dashboard, etc.). We never want to do anything with your work that surprises you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Something else worth noting: Countless Tumblr blogs have gone on to spawn books, films, albums, brands, and more. Any royalties or reimbursement you get for your creations are, needless to say, entirely yours. It&#8217;s your work, and we&#8217;re proud to be a part (however small) of what you accomplish.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

Look out the boldness of the line. :O

> We send two kinds of email: ones about fun stuff happening on Tumblr, and ones with important information about your account. You can opt out of the former, but not the latter.

Seriously ? Drone Technology ? :O

> Tumblr may determine your location by using drone technology and live video feeds. Ha ha, no, we just check out your IP address or any location data you attach to a post. Normal stuff.

Cool One.

> Don‚Äôt make us narc on you. We don‚Äôt want to. But we do need to protect everyone who uses Tumblr from harming us, each other, or themselves. We work hard to balance privacy and community, and we‚Äôre sure you can appreciate the challenges in that, and the seriousness with which we take those challenges.

### Facebook:

Below one is interesting.

> **Information for users outside of the United States and Canada**

### Google:

This is new to me. :O¬† , <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en/program_policies.html" target="_blank">Link</a>.

> ### Account Inactivity
> 
> Google may terminate your account in accordance with the terms of service if you fail to login to your account for a period of nine months.

### Twitter:

<a href="https://twitter.com/tos" target="_blank">Tricky</a> ? :O

> Twitter has an evolving set of [rules][2] for how ecosystem partners can interact with your Content. These rules exist to enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind. But what‚Äôs yours is yours ‚Äì you own your Content (and your photos are part of that Content).

There should be more. I will update this post as soon as i notice that. Thank you for reading. üôÇ
